# 🏁 Sprint 1 Submission Guide

Welcome to **Sprint 1** of the Hushh PDA Hackathon!

This is your **first checkpoint**, and it’s meant to make sure you and your team:

- Understand the goals of the hackathon
- Have chosen a problem to solve
- Have a working setup of the HushhMCP protocol
- Know what you’re building and why

---

## 📦 What You Need to Submit

Please fill out the official **Sprint 1 Check-In Google Form** shared with you. The form will ask for the following:

---

### ✅ 1. GitHub Repo Link

You should have forked the starter repo:
```bash
https://github.com/hushh-labs/consent-protocol
````

Then created your project repo with the naming format:

```
Hushh_Hackathon_Team_<YourTeamName>
```

🔗 Paste that GitHub repo link in the form.

---

### ✅ 2. Agent Name

Pick a name for your agent — e.g.:

* `finance_assistant`
* `calendar_syncer`
* `vault_cleaner`
* `iphone_seller_bot`

Your agent code will eventually live inside:

```
hushh_mcp/agents/<agent_name>/
```

---

### ✅ 3. One-Line Problem Statement

Describe what your agent is trying to solve.

Examples:

* “Summarizes a user’s Gmail receipts and calculates monthly spend.”
* “Helps a user list their old iPhone for resale with pricing suggestions.”
* “Syncs a user’s Google Calendar with their Slack availability.”

---

### ✅ 4. Consent Scope(s) You Plan to Use

Choose one or more of the following scopes your agent will use:

* `vault.read.email`
* `vault.read.finance`
* `agent.identity.verify`
* `custom.your_scope_here`

This tells us what your agent needs access to and will help us evaluate if you're scoping permissions correctly.

---

### ✅ 5. Optional: Early Output or Logs (Text or Screenshot)

If you’ve already started experimenting, feel free to include:

* A screenshot of your code running
* Logs that show token validation working
* Partial JSON outputs

This is optional, but it helps us see your momentum.
